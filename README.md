## Info about my career as a software developer / engineering leader
### General Philosophies
- There is always room for fun.  Humor (at the right time) will decrease stress
- Develop something fast, not perfectly.  You learn more by a feature's use than the coding style to develop it
- 

### Leadership Philosphies
- Don't bring to your team something you just discovered, digest it and see how it can improve your team
- People can take on more than you will think, provide them opportunities and support them, you will almost always be surprised
- There is no job beneath your leadership role.  Lead by doing, and do what needs to be done
