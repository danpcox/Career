# Career
## Info about my career as a software developer / engineering leader
### General Philosophies
- There is always room for fun.  Humor (at the right time) will decrease stress
- Interview. On both sides of the table, the experience is invaluable and the skills you hone are used in every day life
- Bring up issues as soon as possible.  I would rather fail early and loudly than surprise people later on before things can be corrected / modified
- Overcommunicate - failures will happen, a failure by not communicating effectively is avoidable and embarassing
- Ensure that any process / methodology enables you and that you aren't in turn simply enabling the process (e.g. scrum for scrum's sake)



### Leadership Philosphies
- Don't bring to your team something you just discovered, digest it and see how it can improve your team
- People can take on more than you will think, provide them opportunities and support them, you will almost always be surprised
- There is no job beneath your leadership role.  Lead by doing, and do what needs to be done
- The people you support are humans.  You are human.  Take time to acknowledge everybody's humanity and it will lead to more empathy and thoughtfulness
- Don't be afraid to be wrong.  Acknowledge and own your mistakes.  Taking responsibility (especially publically) drives respect/loyalty significantly

### Technical Philosophies
- Develop something fast, not perfectly.  You learn more by a feature's use than the coding style to develop it
