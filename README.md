# Career
## Info about my career as a software developer / engineering leader
### General Philosophies
- There is always room for fun.  Humor (at the right time) will decrease stress
- I strive for efficiency, inefficiency drives me to create fixes and make things more efficient
- Build trust as soon as possible and continually demonstrate trust, without it, you won't succeed
- Interview. On both sides of the table, the experience is invaluable and the skills you hone are used in everyday life
- Bring up issues as soon as possible.  I would rather fail early and loudly than surprise people later on before things can be corrected / modified
- Over Communicate - failures will happen, a failure by not communicating effectively is avoidable and embarrassing
- Ensure that any process / methodology enables you and that you aren't in turn simply enabling the process (e.g. scrum for scrum's sake)
- Be bold. Don't have goals you know you will meet, have goals that stretch you so you grow
- Always be growing. The best way to do that is to get outside of your comfort zone.  Do that just enough and the zone grows with you
- Lack of autonomy will stifle innovation, if you can't take risks you can't grow and learn

### Leadership Philosophies
- Don't bring to your team something you just discovered, digest it and see how it can improve your team
- People can take on more than you will think, provide them opportunities and support them, you will almost always be surprised
- There is no job beneath your leadership role.  Lead by doing, and do what needs to be done
- The people you support are humans.  You are human.  Take time to acknowledge everybody's humanity and it will lead to more empathy and thoughtfulness
- Don't be afraid to be wrong.  Acknowledge and own your mistakes.  Taking responsibility (especially publically) drives respect/loyalty significantly
- Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand. Don't be afraid to look ignorant, odds are someone else in the room is hesitant to ask the same question
- The Culture is so important, it needs to embody (at every level): risk taking, autonomy, accountability, recognition, and incentivization
- Never hire the brilliant jerk. The team and culture matter more than someone brought on to help as an expert
- The front-line manager is one of the hardest roles, they are leading the charge and coding / architecting.  I have great respect for this position
- Apathy is just as important as empathy. Know when to be invested, but just as importantly, know when not to


### Technical Philosophies
- Being able to code is a superpower, it's easy to forget others don't know how / can't
- Develop something fast, not perfectly.  You learn more by a feature's use than the coding style to develop it
- Don't set out to learn a new technology unless you have a reason to use it
- Become a master at one technology rather than dabble in many, you will code and deploy much faster the more you know the intricacies of your chose environment
- Front end development is just as important as back-end. At Amazon I was looked down on because I liked front end, if the UI isn't working you won't get any RPS for your backend!
- Sometimes it makes sense to build your own, often it doesn't. Don't assume if you don't build it it won't be quality, but do the leg-work to verify it is solid
- Take time to learn, it doesn't need to be a new language, but with AI developing at astonishing rates you can't afford to be left behind
- The engineering strategy needs to be as closely aligned with the product strategy as possible, otherwise conflict will arise
